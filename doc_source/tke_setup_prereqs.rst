Prerequisites for Installing and Using the |tke|
################################################

The |tke| has the following prerequisites:

* :emphasis:`An Amazon Web Services account` |ndash| To obtain an AWS account, go to the `AWS home
  page <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ and click :guilabel:`Sign Up Now`. Signing up will enable you to
  use all of the services offered by AWS.

* :emphasis:`A supported operating system` |ndash| The |tke| is supported on Windows, |unixes|.

* :emphasis:`Java 1.6 or later`

* :emphasis:`Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 3.6 or later` |ndash| We attempt to keep the |tke|
  current with the default version available on the `Eclipse download page
  <https://eclipse.org/downloads/>`_.

  .. tip:: Eclipse provides a number of different downloads. We recommend installing the
      :emphasis:`Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers`, which includes the `Eclipse Web Tools Platform
      <http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=webtools>`_ required by |EB|,
      and the `Eclipse Data Tools Platform <http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/>`_ required for |SDB|
      features. If you install another version of Eclipse, make sure that you have (or that you
      install, using the provided links) support for these features.

* :emphasis:`(Optional) Google Android Development Tools (ADT)` |ndash| if you want |tke| support
  for the `AWS SDK for Android <http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/>`_, you must `install the ADT
  <https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html>`_ first.

Once you have met these prerequisites, you can :doc:`install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
<tke_setup_install>`.
